Timestamp Component

Just needs the timestamp_id

It will reference the store for the needed data, like:
	timestmap data for the start time
	episode data for the episode name
	linked episode data for displaying the check mark to indicate episode video file is on the server
		would not be in the case for live sports initially/ watching videos not on youtube
